name: Titanium.App
summary: |
    The top level App module. The App module is mainly used for accessing information about the 
    application at runtime.
description: |
    The `App` module exposes a number of properties set in the `tiapp.xml` file.  
    
    Three of these properties, the application name, ID, and URL, must be specified when the 
    application is created.  
    
    While most values may be changed by editing the `tiapp.xml` file after creating the project, 
    the GUID is automatically generated and should not be changed.

events:
  - name: pause
    summary: Fired when the application transitions to the background on a multitasked system.
    description: |
        Available on iOS 4.0 and later.
        
        This event fires when the user leaves the application or it is paused due to a notification 
        or incoming phone call.  
        
        See the `applicationWillResignActive` section of the official Apple documentation about 
        [Monitoring Application State Changes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006786-CH3-SW5) 
        for the exact behavior that triggers this event.
        
        Note that calls to functions that modify the UI during this event may be partially executed, 
        **up to** the UI call before the suspension. If this happens, the remainder of the code will 
        be executed after the application is resumed, but before the `resume` event is triggered.

  - name: proximity
    summary: Fired when the proximity sensor changes state.
    description: |
        The proximity sensor detects whether the device is being held up to the user's ear, 
        and shuts down the display.

        Proximity events are only fired when [proximityDetection](Titanium.App.proximityDetection) 
        is `true`.
    properties:
      - name: state
        summary: Proximity state value.

  - name: resume
    summary: Fired when the application returns to the foreground on a multitasked system.
    description: |
        Available on iOS 4.0 and later.
        
        Note that this event does not fire for pauses resulting from notifications or incoming phone 
        calls.
        
        See the `applicationWillEnterForeground` section of the official Apple documentation about 
        [Monitoring Application State Changes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006786-CH3-SW5)

        returns to focus after a notification or incoming phone call.
        
        See the `applicationDidBecomeActive` section of the official Apple documentation about 
        [Monitoring Application State Changes](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006786-CH3-SW5)

  - name: keyboardFrameChanged
    summary: Fired when the soft keyboard is presented, on and off the screen.
    description: |
        This event fires when the application presents the soft keyboard on/off the screen . The 
        event returns the dictionary containing `keyboardFrame.x`, `keyboardFrame.y`, 
        `keyboardFrame.height` and `keyboardFrame.width` variables, corresponding to the frame of 
        the keyboard with respect to the screen coordinates.
        
        Note that the keyboard `height` and `width` properties will not be accurate when the keyboard 
        is being dissmissed.
